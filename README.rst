Code to support working with Celery, a distributed task queue.

Overview (please modify)
------------------------

This package contains utilities to wrap tasks with logging and to
persist them if they fail.

It also supports Django administration for searching and deleting
failed tasks, and management commands for rerunning failed tasks and
deleting old ones.

Documentation
-------------

(TODO: `Set up documentation <https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/21627535/Publish+Documentation+on+Read+the+Docs>`_)
